    "explanation": "Inheritance is an OOP principle where a subclass (child) extends a superclass (parent) and inherits its fields and methods. In SPLAT: Statement is a parent class, and PrintStatement, Assignment, IfThenElse are subclasses that extend Statement. Use 'extends' keyword in Java.",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Example in SPLAT: All Statement subclasses can be stored in List<Statement>, and calling stmt.execute() invokes the appropriate subclass method (PrintStatement.execute(), Assignment.execute(), etc.). This is runtime polymorphism (dynamic dispatch).",

    "explanation": "Exceptions provide a way to handle errors gracefully.

All SPLAT exceptions extend SplatException, which tracks line/column numbers.",
